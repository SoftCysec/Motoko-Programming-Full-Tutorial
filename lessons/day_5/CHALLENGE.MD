# Challenge : day 5 ü¶Ü

# Prerequisites ‚úÖ

- Make sure you've read all the instructions on how to complete the challenges.

- Follow along with the daily guide.

# Coding üßë‚Äçüíª

- Challenge 1 : Write a function <strong> <i> is_anonymous </i> </strong> that takes no arguments but returns **true** is the caller is anonymous and **false** otherwise.

- Challenge 2 : Create an HashMap called favoriteNumber where the keys are **Principal** and the value are **Nat**.

- Challenge 3 : Write two functions :

  - <strong> <i> add_favorite_number </i> </strong> that takes n of type **Nat** and stores this value in the HashMap where the key is the principal of the caller. This function has no return value.
  - <strong> <i> show_favorite_number </i> </strong> that takes no argument and returns n of type **?Nat**, n is the favorite number of the person as defined in the previous function or null if the person hasn't registered.

- Challenge 4 : Rewrite your function <strong> <i> add_favorite_number </i> </strong> so that if the caller has already registered his favorite number, the value in memory isn't modified. This function will return a text of type **Text** that indicates "You've already registered your number" in that case and "You've successfully registered your number" in the other scenario.

- Challenge 5 : Write two functions

  - <strong> <i> update_favorite_number </strong> </i>
  - <strong> <i> delete_favorite_number </strong> </i>

- Challenge 6 : Write a function <strong> <i> deposit_cycles </strong> </i> that allow anyone to deposit cycles into the canister. This function takes no parameter but returns n of type **Nat** corresponding to the amount of cycles deposited by the call.

- Challenge 7 (hard ‚ö†Ô∏è) : Write a function <strong> <i> withdraw_cycles </strong> </i> that takes a parameter n of type **Nat** corresponding to the number of cycles you want to withdraw from the canister and send it to caller asumming the caller has a callback called deposit_cycles()<br/>
  Note : You need two canisters. <br/>
  Note 2 : Don't do that in production without admin protection or your might be the target of a **cycle draining** attack.

- Challenge 8 : Rewrite the counter (of day 1) but this time the counter will be kept accross ugprades. Also declare a variable of type **Nat** called versionNumber that will keep track of how many times your canister has been upgraded.

- Challenge 9 : In a new file, copy and paste the functionnalities you've created in challenges 2 to 5. This time the hashmap and all records should be preserved accross upgrades.

- Challenge 10 (optional) : In autonomy, write a CRUD canister, you can add as much functionnalities as you want, a few examples :

  - Anonymous principal rejection.
  - Cycle functionnality for registration.
  - Admin management.

Note : Only practice challenge 10 if you wish to, this is optional and it will not be taken into account for any ranking.
